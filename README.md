# 🕌 Islamic Text Classifier (AI/NLP Project)

This is a simple but powerful machine learning project that classifies whether a given piece of text is **Islamic** (faith-related) or **Non-Islamic** (general/worldly content). It’s my first practical step toward building an explainable Muslim scholar chatbot, guided by responsible and transparent AI.

## 📌 Project Overview

- **Goal**: Train an NLP model to distinguish Islamic vs Non-Islamic content.
- **Tech Stack**: Python, scikit-learn, TF-IDF vectorizer, Naive Bayes classifier
- **Dataset**: 200 text samples (100 Islamic, 100 Non-Islamic), curated for balance and clarity.

## 📊 Results

Achieved **100% accuracy** on a validation set using traditional ML techniques.
